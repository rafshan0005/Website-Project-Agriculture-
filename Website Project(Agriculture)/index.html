The mandate of the Division is rice variety development, germplasm conservation &amp; management and seed technology research.  As this division maintain the germplasm conservation which is the key component of any research program. This division also play vital role to earn the maximum number in APA through Breeder Seed Production and distribution. The major achievement of this division is as follows: 
<div>
</div><div>1. Developed an aromatic rice variety (BRRI dhan 34 from Khaskani), which is very popular throughout the country
</div><div>2. Long term genebank (2000 CFT volume) was established in 2007 with a storage facility of 22,000 germplasm for a duration of 50- 100 years 
</div><div>3. A total of 8604 landraces of rice were collected and conserved as long, medium and short term storage.
</div><div>4. More than 1000 local varieties were evaluated against biotic and abiotic factors of which 62 local varieties were utilized in the hybridization program for developing new varieties
</div><div>5. At least 1610 exotic varieties were collected and preserved. 
</div><div>6. More than 90 wild rice samples are conserved in BRRI as Ex-situ field Gene Bank 
</div><div>7. Till date, 270 traditional rice varieties were used as parents in crossing program of BRRI HQ and 12 rice varieties were released by utilizing traditional varieties as one of the parent (BR3, BR22, BR23, BR25, BRRI dhan31, BRRI dhan37, BRRI dhan38, BRRI dhan46 and BRRI dhan47, BRRI dhan55, BRRI dhan62) where as BR5 and BRRI dhan34 were released from selection within landraces
</div><div>8. So far 1200 rice varieties /germplasm have been characterized at molecular level using SSR marker
</div><div>9. All the information of BRRI rice germplasm had been incorporated in Global Plan of Action’2020 of FAO
</div><div>10. BRRI Genebank has pioneered in Bangladesh for registration of a total of 70 (seventy) germplasms with DOI in Global Information System (GLIS) of Article 17 of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) by FAO
</div><div>11. A sustainable rice seed network is developed and playing a vital role in delivering breeder seed to the seed producing organizations.  Accordingly supply of quality seed increases to many folds and farmers are immensely benefitted that help in ensuring food security 
</div><div>12. More than hundred (100) tons of breeder seed of BRRI developed rice varieties were supplied to about 900 Seed Net partners including BADC every year. And thus directly contributing in achieving SDG Goal “Zero hunger” and Food Security. 
</div><div>13. In November’2020 two rice germplasm of Bangladesh had been registered as Geographical Indication (GI) rice from the Department of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks of Bangladesh and named as Bangladesh Kalijira and Dinajpur Kataribhog by the heartiest efforts of the Scientists of GRS Division.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Using 80-100 g/m2 seed at seed bed can produce healthier seedling. Using transparent polyethene cover on seedbed at night in colder environment is recommended in cold prone region of Bangladesh.  
<br>After rescission of flood water 2-3 tillers could be separation from unaffected mother hill and re-transplanted in new field. Split tiller could cover similar or more area using BRRI recommended practice during scarcity of seedling.
<br>To develop quality seedling in tray for mechanical transplanter 25% rice husk + 75% loamy soil is better to raise healthier seedling in Boro seasons.
<br>Rice seedling with 25 to 30-days old for Boro season and 15-16-days old for Aman season with 12-15 cm height is suitable for transplanting using mechanical transplanter.
<br>In flooded condition floating seedbed is one of the best options for raising rice seedlings. Quality rice seedling could raise within 20-25 days on 2-3 cm of mud layer on bamboo mat/banana raft. 
<br>The suitable planting time for T. Aman season is mid of July to August. However, photosensitive variety could transplant up to mid of September after rescission of flood water. For Boro season, planting should complete in January, nevertheless in cold prone region of Bangladesh, February could also consider.
<br>Cultivation of short duration rice varieties (i.e. BRRI dhan33) in early Aman season (July) with proper crop management solved Monga in Rangpur region of Bangladesh. As it contributes to the food security of the country and Dr. M A Majid, former head of Agronomy division, received the National Independence award in 2018.
<br>Sulfur deficiency in rice was first detected in 1975 at some areas in Bangladesh by Agronomy Division. Gypsum is an easily available source to mitigate sulfur deficiency according to the soil test.
<br>In direct wet seeded rice (DWSR), BRRI dhn29 required 150-160 kg/ha for higher grain yield (7.1-7.4 t/ha) following alternate wetting and drying system.
<br>Combine use of fresh poultry liter (FPL) with chemical fertilizer (STB) could achieve higher grain yield. In T. Aman and Boro seasons, respectively 2.5 and 3.5 t/ha FPL and the rest amount of nutrients from chemical fertilizers (STB) is the best option for higher grain yield.
<br>For balance use of fertilizer, NPK briquettes about 2.4 g × 2 and 3.4 g × 1 showed better performance in yield of rice and higher fertilizer use efficiency in Boro and Aman season, respectively.
<br>The submergence tolerant varieties such as BRRI dhan51 and BRRI dhan52 produced 1.0-1.5 t/ha higher grain yield if, 30 kg/ha Nitrogen fertilizer apply at 5-15 days after recision of the flood water, in Rangpur region.
<br>For rice cultivation on low laying peat soil area in the greater Faridpur region, TSP and other fertilizer should use as soil test-based for significant amount of grain yield.
<br>The critical weed density was determined in Aman season is 9 weeds (grass, sedge or broad leaved) per square meter with weed dry matter 11.92 g/m2.
<br>For chemical weed control, efficient herbicide and rate is recommended by Agronomy division. Among the herbicides some potential pre-emergence is as mefeneset+bensulfuran methyl, bensulfuran methyl + acetachlor; and some post emergence herbicides are pyrazosulfuran ethyl, penoxsulam, bispyribac sodium are very effective to control weed in transplanted rice. On the other hand, pendimethalin, oxadiargyl, oxadiazon are effective for weed control in upland rice.
<br>The chemical herbicides paraquat, glyphosate is very effective and cost saving for controlling aquatic weeds in single cropped area.
<br>USG application before panicle initiation stage increase grain yield (0.5 t/ha) of local aman rice varieties in tidal flooded ecosystem.
<br>Cultivation of BRRI dhan47, BRRI dhan67 with 20×20 cm spacing with 3-4 plants/hill in salinity region of Bangladesh gave maximum grain yield.
<br>Urea application (300 kg/ha) in four splits (at 20, 40, 60 &amp; 80 DAT) has proposed by Agronomy for higher yield (6.5-7.3 t/ha) for mechanically transplanted long duration rice in Boro season.
<br>Transplanting of 25 days old seedling at 20×15 cm spacing on 4th week of July along with pre or post-emergence or combined use of herbicide is suitable to cultivate drought tolerant short duration aman rice in Rangpur region.
<br>If the land is not kept weed free for 30-40 days in Aus and Aman seasons and 40-50 days in Boro season, the damage cannot be compensated even if the land is kept weed free throughout the season.
<br>In transplanted rice, at least two hand weeding is required at 15 days and 30-35 days after transplanting. When the land dries up or at late irrigation, the number of weeds increases and consequently, third hand weeding is required at 45-50 days in the Boro season.
<br>Rabi-Jute-relay Local B. Aman cultivation in Greater Faridpur region was introduced by BRRI dhan66, BRRI dhan56, BRRI dhan57 and BRRI dhan62 instead of local rice varieties gave 1.8-2.2 t/ha higher grain yield. After harvesting of Jute, Aman rice seedlings should be top dress and weed out properly.
<br>Integrated rice-duck culture is a novel way of controlling weeds in wetland rice fields. Two weeks after rice transplanting, 25-30 days old ducks are driven to the rice field regularly where they feed on the weeds. On the other hand, duck droppings supply nutrients to the soil which minimize the chemical fertilizer doses.
<br>Farmers can get more benefit by practicing Potato-Mungbean-T.Aus-T.Aman cropping pattern instead of the conventional Potato-Maize-T.Aman or Boro-Fallow-T.Aman cropping pattern in the medium high land of Rangpur region with maintaining soil fertility.</p>
